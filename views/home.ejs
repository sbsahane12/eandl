            <h2>About the Scheme</h2>
            <p>Late Padmashri Dr. Vitthalrao Vikhe Patil, founder father of the institute, started the “Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil Earn and Learn Scheme” in 1971 at the time of establishment of the institute. The main objective of the scheme is to help poor and needy students to pursue higher education independently. It aims to inculcate the habit of self-discipline and cultivate the dignity of labour among the students. The scheme develops a student as a multifaceted personality with academic excellence and a commitment to an egalitarian society. Further, this scheme gives hands-on experience of official, technical and fieldwork to the students to enhance their employability.</p>
            <p>This scheme is basically undertaken for the benefit of students coming from rural areas, which are economically backward, intelligent, and meritorious but cannot afford higher education. It is found that most of the students admitted in the scheme were having an inferiority complex and felt isolated. This scheme helps such students to overcome these problems by instilling work ethics, self-discipline, confidence building, and personality development among them. This scheme provides official and technical work exposure to the students. This scheme helps students to be socialized and instill team spirit. This is a vision of keeping our youth gainfully employed as well as contributing to civil society. The students from economically marginalized sections who have the urge to pursue higher education but are unable to work outside due to constraints of time, this scheme offers opportunities to learn by earning.</p>
            <p>Students who are admitted to the college are eligible to apply for this scheme. Interested students have to fill up the necessary form. The ‘Earn and Learn Committee’ scrutinizes the collected forms. The Principal approves the list of selected students. The committee allots work that can be easily done by the selected candidates. However, when the work is distributed care is taken that each student gets eighty percent of technical work and twenty percent of fieldwork. Office work includes library work such as stacking, tagging, and sorting of books or any administrative office work. Technical work includes data entry, filling forms, filing, and photocopying etc., while fieldwork includes garden work, maintenance of playgrounds, and cleanliness of the campus, etc. Each student is expected to work for three hours daily. Students working under this scheme are paid Rs.45 per hour.</p>
            <p>These students are provided hostel and mess facilities at concessional rates. Every year, Mattresses, mosquito nets, and warm clothes are provided through personal funds of Late Dr. Balasaheb Vikhe Patil (Padmabhushan awardee), Former Chairman PRES. Along with it, the book bank facility is also made available. The institute provides financial assistance through the poor boys' fund and renders assistance in availing scholarships from various agencies. Students are motivated through the ‘Best Student Award’ and ‘ShekharSuman Award’ for their dedication to work and outstanding performance. The success of the scheme is evident from the number of students enrolled and the amount spent during the last five years.</p>
            <p>Also, it has been noticed that the majority of the students participating in the scheme are toppers in their class. Many times, the students of this scheme have bagged the prestigious ‘Principal Dr. Mohanrao Hapase Best Student Award’ which is given to all-rounder students of the college. Most of the past students have proved themselves and are successful in every walk of life.</p>
